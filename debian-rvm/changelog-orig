smplayer (16.6.0) precise; urgency=low

  * Support for 2 in 1 computers with touch screens.
    SMPlayer includes now a 'tablet mode', available in the menu Options.
    When the option is turned on it makes some changes in the interface
    so that it would be easier to control SMPlayer by touching the

    bookmarks on YouTube videos or other online streams (as long as they
    are seekable).

     for the rest of sites
     YouTube: only the internal support for YouTube will be used
     mpv + youtube-dl: uses mpv + youtube-dl for all sites
  * An animated icon has been added in the status bar to indicate when the player
    is buffering.
