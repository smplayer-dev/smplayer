//! MyProcess is a specialized QProcess designed to properly work with mplayer.

/*!
 It can split the mplayer status line into lines.
 It also provides some Qt 3 like functions like addArgument().

 There are two working modes, controlled by the USE_TEMP_FILE define.
 If USE_TEMP_FILE is 1 it will send the output of mplayer to a temporary
 file, and then it will be read from it. Otherwise it will read from
 standard ouput as usual.
