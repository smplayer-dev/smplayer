    SMPlayer intends to be a complete front-end for MPlayer, from basic
    features like playing videos, DVDs, and VCDs to more advanced features
    like support for MPlayer filters and more.

    To know how to compile and install smplayer please read Install.txt.

    There are available two optional packages: smplayer-themes and smplayer-skins.
    They contain some icon themes and skins for smplayer and it's highly recommended
    that you install them too.
