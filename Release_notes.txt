   can adjust manually the scale factor or turn off this feature.

   Now it's possible to use the media keys (play/pause, stop, volume+/-,
   etc.) as global shortcuts. That means that those keys will work even
   when SMPlayer is in the background. You can activate this option in

   mouse -> Mouse -> Drag function: seek and volume.
 * A fix for saving bookmarks.
 * The option for streaming sites in Preferences -> Network is
   different now, and allows these values:

     for the rest of sites
     YouTube: only the internal support for YouTube will be used
     mpv + youtube-dl: uses mpv + youtube-dl for all sites
